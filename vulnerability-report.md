# Vulnerability Report

## Vulnerabilities
1) To my knowledge our database has not been steralized, so if people enter in strange usernames or account info, it could affect the databases. 
2) If someone enters actual credit card info, it could be stored un-hashed and therefore not safe. 
3) Could work harder on hashing sensative info (currently only passwords I believe), 
4) Could add extra authentication to logins, and/or limit the user to X failed attempts
